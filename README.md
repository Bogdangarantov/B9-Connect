<!-- You can add a footnote by using this bracket syntax:

Here is a simple footnote.[^1]

A footnote can also have multiple lines.[^2]

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: To add line breaks within a footnote, prefix new lines with 2 spaces.
  This is a second line.

Note: The position of a footnote in your Markdown does not influence where the footnote will be rendered. You can write a footnote right after your reference to the footnote, and the footnote will still render at the bottom of the Markdown.
Footnotes are not supported in wikis.
